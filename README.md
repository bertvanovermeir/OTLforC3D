# OTLforC3D

ALPHA version - testing purposes only - no compiled sources available yet

to run the program, compile it and add the directory with the binaries to the trusted Civil3D path variable.

run accoreconsole.exe from Autodesk/autocad 2022 program files with the following arguments:

accoreconsole.exe /i ...path to some dwg file... /s ...path to script (.scr) file...
  
  
good luck
