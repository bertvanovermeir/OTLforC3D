# OTLforC3D

ALPHA version - testing purposes only - no compiled sources available yet

To run the program, compile it and add the directory with the binaries to the trusted Civil3D path variable.
Change the path to the SQL_DB in the settings.dat file.
Run accoreconsole.exe from Autodesk/autocad 2022 program files with the following arguments:
Accoreconsole.exe /i ...path to some dwg file... /s ...path to script (.scr) file...
  
Program will spit out a DWG file with OTL subset properties attached
  
good luck
